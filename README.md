#üê∂**Pet Adoption Prediction using PetFinder.my Dataset**üê±

## ü¶¥Project Overviewü¶¥

This project aims to predict the likelihood of pet adoption based on various features such as pet characteristics, health status, and adoption speed. We apply various machine learning techniques, including classification models and clustering algorithms, to analyze the dataset and make predictions about pet adoption.

## **Getting Started**

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
https://github.com/AleexBap/Machine-Learning.git
```

### 2. Install Required Libraries

Once your environment is set up, install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies for running the project.

## **Usage**

After installing the dependencies, you can run the Jupyter notebook for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

### Example (Jupyter Notebook):

1. Start Jupyter notebook in the terminal:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open and run the `AA202425_Group28.ipynb` notebook.

## **Model Evaluation**

We evaluate our models using various metrics, including:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**
- **ROC AUC Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Silhouette Score (for clustering)**
